## Hi there 👋

My name is Jacob Baker. I’m a Computer Engineering major at the University of Delaware with a minor in Computer Science. My interests sit at the intersection of **systems, data, and AI**, with a strong focus on applying modern tools to real technical problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on undergraduate research through UD’s VIP program, where I’m building and evaluating an **LLM-based summarizer for HPC I/O performance logs (Darshan)**, with an emphasis on consistency, coverage, and evaluation methodology.
- ⚙️ I’m actively developing projects in **systems and low-level software**, currently working on an **MES shop-floor event tracker** for ingesting production data and computing operational metrics..
- 🤖 I’m exploring **machine learning and applied AI**, particularly how LLMs can be used as analysis tools rather than black-box generators.
- 🌱 I’m continuing to build experience in **embedded systems and hardware–software integration**, alongside a growing interest in **data-oriented and AI-focused engineering roles**.

I enjoy projects that combine theory with practical impact, especially where careful evaluation, performance, and correctness matter.
