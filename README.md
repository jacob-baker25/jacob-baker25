## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Baker. I am a computer engineering major at the University of Delaware. I am interested in both cybersecurity and embedded systems, and I am excited to keep learning more. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adding to a previous IoT project I did using an Arduino Uno.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data structures and algorithms by practicing on LeetCode. I am also exploring
      the fundamentals of security operations (SecOps) to potentially persue a job as an SOC Analyst.
